# Rexy obstacle jumper
Making this bot project to learn about genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning.

Only works on a mac with retina display (retina does wierd things which i have to account for).

Got tired of turning off the internet access each time I needed to test the code so I found the game [here](https://www.trex-game.skipser.com/) instead.

## Todo
- FPS suddenly dropped to around 3,5 - find out why
- Use template matching instead of absolute coordinates when clicking to start new game
- Test out the GA on a toy problem (solve a polynomial)
- Give jumpy v5 a spin!
